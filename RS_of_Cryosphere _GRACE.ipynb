    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is the largest block of ice on Earth. It is unique by its thickness, which averages 2 160 meters, and its surface of approximately 14 million square kilometers (an area larger than Europe), making it the biggest freshwater reservoir in the world. The ice sheet on the continent extends over the ocean and becomes ice shelf. This mass of ice plays a crucial role in the regulation of the Earth Climate, thanks to the relfective properties of the white ice covered areas surrounded by the dark sea surface, or the cold ocean surrounding the continent driving the oceaninc circulation around the globe. Its dynamics and evolution is a topic of significant concern for the scientific community.\n",
    "\n",
    "Antarctica is particularly sensible to climate change, although there is a large climate variability over the region. The continent lies at the crossroads of numerous forcings : the ozone hole, disturbances caused by tropical storms and moonsoons, and of course the increases of greenhous gases in the atmosphere. This makes the Antartic Ice Sheet highly dynamic: climate records from the Antartic Peninsula show that  temperatures in this region rose by around 3.2°C in the second half of the 20th century, which is more than three times the global average. West Antartica has been melting at an accelerating rate, while the data on East Antarctica is less clear. In the end, as many unknowns remain about the processes governing the region and its potential feedback responses to climate change, there are still many uncertainties in the future contribution of the melting of the AIS to sea-level rise. According to the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), even in the most extreme emissions scenario where surface mass gains in the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) compensate for projected ice mass loss, the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is projected to contribute only a modest -0.08 to 0.14 meters to global sea level rise by the year 2100 ([Church et al., 2013](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/WG1AR5_Chapter13_FINAL.pdf)). On the other hand, in a high-temperature scenario, the expert assessment conducted by [Bamber et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1817205116) estimated a likely range of 0.03 to 0.46 meters from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and a range of -0.04 to 0.11 meters from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) for the year 2100. These estimates are expected to increase to a range of 0.07 to 2.28 meters (WAIS) and -0.14 to 0.51 meters (EAIS) by the year 2300.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring the evolution of the AIS is therefore crucial to understand climate change and forecasts its future impacts across the globe. Measuring the mass of the Antarctic Ice sheet is however still a complex scientific task, and many methods exist including satellite altimetry, gravimetry, ice core analysis, ground-based GPS, airborne surveys, ice sheet models, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we are going to use the [Gravimetric mass balance data for the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets from 2003 to 2020 derived from satellite observations](https://www.wekeo.eu/data?view=dataset&dataset=EO%3AECMWF%3ADAT%3ASATELLITE_ICE_SHEET_MASS_BALANCE) product. This dataset offers a comprehensive collection of monthly time series data depicting alterations in mass for the drainage basins of both the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets. These data are sourced from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions, which have been in operation since 2002 to the present day. These observations align with the targets established by the Global Climate Observing System for the Essential Climate Variable of Ice Sheets Mass Change. The GRACE twin satellites, through their monitoring of fluctuations in Earth's gravitational field, have allowed us to deduce changes in mass across the ice sheets using a regional integration approach. This dataset includes **time series data** illustrating **mass changes** for each individual ice sheet as well as for each specific drainage basin.\n",
