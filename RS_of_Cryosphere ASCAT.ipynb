    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface melt on the Antarctic Ice Sheet is a critical component of sea level rise projections, with estimates varying widely due to uncertainties surrounding the future of Antarctic ice shelves. \n",
    "While enhanced basal melt and iceberg calving currently dominate ice mass loss, surface melt, though playing a marginal role, can indirectly contribute by destabilizing ice shelves. Recent climate models predict a doubling of Antarctic surface melt by 2050, driven by atmospheric warming, potentially leading to significant increases in sea level rise contribution. Monitoring surface melt is essential for understanding these dynamics and refining projections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, three methods are utilized to estimate surface melt: automatic weather stations (AWSs), physics-based (regional) climate models (RCMs), and remote sensing. AWS observations facilitate the computation of surface energy balance and the estimation of excess energy available for surface melt. Initially, studies relied on temperature data from AWSs dating back to 1947, with subsequent research utilizing more advanced AWSs equipped with radiation sensors. While AWS observations are often considered \"ground truth,\" their limitation lies in being point-based and restricted to a limited number of locations, thus inadequate for continentwide melt studies. Additionally, AWS locations are biased toward homogeneous snow surfaces, overlooking more complex surface types like blue ice, slush, and other wet surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method employs RCMs to estimate surface melt on a continental scale. However, the accuracy of RCMs depends on the resolution and precision of the forcing data, which often fall short for the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Furthermore, RCMs struggle to capture detailed melt features over low albedo regions due to their limited resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote sensing provides an alternative for deriving long-term melt dynamics, offering various spatiotemporal resolutions. Various sensors, including radiometers, scatterometers, synthetic aperture radar, and optical sensors, enable the detection of wet surface conditions such as wet snow, slush, melt ponds, and streams. These sensors provide data for assessing the spatial and temporal patterns of surface melt, offering insights into its duration and distribution across the continent. \n",
    "Satellites equipped with remote sensing technology offer insights into the Antarctic surface across a broad spectrum of electromagnetic wavelengths, ranging from visible light to microwaves. These sensors detect surface reflectance, backscatter intensity (σ0), and brightness temperature (Tb). Changes in these parameters indicate the presence of liquid water, serving as indicators for its presence rather than directly observing the physical process of surface melt. Surface melt is essentially an energy conversion process, although thermal-infrared-derived surface temperature can pinpoint its occurrence at the melting point. Despite this distinction, the term \"surface melt\" is commonly used in remote sensing discourse. However, sensors primarily detect the presence of liquid water.\n",
    "Furthermore, observations of backscatter intensity, brightness temperature, and surface reflectance are influenced by sensor characteristics and surface properties. Consequently, significant disparities can arise in surface melt estimates derived from different sensors, highlighting the importance of considering these factors when interpreting remote sensing data.\n",
    "By exploiting satellite technology, researchers can enhance our understanding of Antarctic surface melt dynamics and their implications for future sea level rise."

    "## Stack reprojection\n",
    "\n",
    "EPSG (European Petroleum Survey Group) codes are a standard way to reference coordinate systems and projections. In Antarctica, EPSG reprojections are commonly used to transform spatial data from one coordinate reference system to another. This is crucial for various applications such as mapping, geospatial analysis, and satellite imagery interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common EPSG code used in Antarctica is EPSG:3031, which represents the Antarctic Polar Stereographic projection. This projection is specifically designed for the polar regions and is optimized for accurate representation of areas near the poles. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Projection**: The Antarctic Polar Stereographic projection projects the spherical surface of the Earth onto a two-dimensional plane. It uses a stereographic projection method, which means that lines of longitude are projected as straight lines radiating from a point at the center of the projection, while lines of latitude are projected as concentric circles centered on that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Datum**: The EPSG:3031 projection typically uses the WGS 84 datum, which is a global geodetic datum widely used in GPS systems and mapping applications. The WGS 84 datum defines the shape and size of the Earth's ellipsoid and serves as a reference for geospatial data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Parameters**: The EPSG:3031 projection has specific parameters that define how the projection is applied, such as the central meridian and the latitude of true scale. In the case of EPSG:3031, the central meridian is set to 0 degrees, and the latitude of true scale is set to -71 degrees (for the southern hemisphere).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Transformation**: When data in a different coordinate reference system (CRS) needs to be displayed or analyzed alongside data in EPSG:3031, a reprojection is performed. This involves transforming the coordinates of each point in the original CRS to their equivalent coordinates in EPSG:3031. This transformation takes into account the mathematical formulas and parameters of the specific projections involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "EPSG reprojections in Antarctica, particularly using EPSG:3031, enable accurate representation and analysis of spatial data in a way that is optimized for the unique characteristics of the polar region."

    "To ensure the captured data corresponded to the end of the melt season, the study focuses exclusively on afternoon (6 PM) observations, as morning observations (6 AM) exhibit less melting [Trusel, L. D., et al. (2012). Antarctic surface melting dynamics: Enhanced perspectives from radar scatterometer data. Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface, 117(F2).]. \n",
    "The melt detection algorithm proposed by Ashcraft [Ashcraft, I. S., & Long, D. G. (2006). Comparison of methods for melt detection over Greenland using active and passive microwave measurements. International Journal of Remote Sensing, 27(12), 2469-2488.] is implemented, assuming the presence of melt when the backscatter intensity falls below the annual winter mean by a threshold of 3 dB. Melt periods need to encompass four consecutive observations, with at least three out of the four observations indicating melt. Individual melt days are excluded, as a longer duration of melting is deemed necessary for aquifer formation. The last day of melt within the final selected melt period represents the \"end of the melt season\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now going to calculate the last day of melt up to June 30th of each year. Specifically, we are interested in identifying the final day of melt during the first half of the year. We won't include late melt days in this analysis. \"Late melt\" in Antarctica typically refers to the period of time during the austral summer (December to February) when surface melting of ice and snow occurs later than usual. This phenomenon can have various causes, including weather patterns, atmospheric conditions, and changes in regional climate."

    "A Regional Climate Model (RCM) is a type of atmospheric model designed to simulate climate conditions over a specific region at a certain spatial resolution. RCMs contain mathematical equations that represent physical processes such as radiation, convection, and advection, similar to global climate models but focused on a smaller geographical area.\n",

RACMO aims to provide detailed information about atmospheric variables such as temperature, precipitation, wind patterns, and humidity over these regions.\n",
    "To create RACMO, scientists collect observational data from various sources such as weather stations, satellites, and field campaigns. This observational data is used to initialize the model and to validate its performance. The model equations are then solved numerically using computer simulations to predict how the climate will evolve over time under different scenarios and forcings.\n",
    "RACMO incorporates processes specific to polar regions, such as ice melt, snow accumulation, and atmospheric circulation patterns, to provide accurate simulations of the climate in these areas. It can be used to study the impacts of climate change on polar ice sheets, sea ice extent, and regional climate variability.\n",

    "in the context of RACMO, melt flux refers to the rate at which snow or ice melts and releases liquid water into the environment. It's measured as the volume of water produced per unit area over a specific time period, such as millimeters per day. Factors like temperature, solar radiation, wind, and topography influence melt flux. Understanding melt flux is crucial for assessing freshwater resources, hydrological cycles, and the impacts of climate change on snow and ice dynamics.\n",
